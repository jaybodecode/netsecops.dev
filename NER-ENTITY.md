Of course. It's a common and interesting challenge when a general-purpose language model fails on a specialized vocabulary. Your instinct to move beyond simple trigrams is correct, as they are very sensitive to minor changes in wording and punctuation.

Based on your needs—a Node.js environment, a cybersecurity corpus, and issues with compiled libraries—**`wink-nlp` is your best starting point**, but a hybrid approach will likely yield the best results.

Here’s a breakdown of your options and a recommended path forward.

### SQLite Extensions for Text Comparison

You're right to look at the database layer. While a standard SQLite instance doesn't perform semantic search, it has powerful extensions that can significantly improve your situation.

  * **Full-Text Search (FTS5):** This is your best built-in option. FTS5 is an extension that creates special indexes for fast and sophisticated text searching. It's much more powerful than a simple `LIKE` query.

      * **What it's good for:** It excels at **lexical search**, not semantic. It calculates relevance scores (like Okapi BM25) to find documents that are most relevant to a query based on the words they contain.
      * **How it helps you:** You could use it as a first-pass filter. Instead of comparing every document to every other document, you can use one document's key terms to query FTS5 and find the top 50 most lexically similar documents. This dramatically reduces the number of pairs you need to compare with a more advanced library.

  * **Vector Search Extensions (e.g., `sqlite-vss`):** To get true semantic search, you need to store and search vector embeddings. While SQLite doesn't do this natively, third-party extensions like `sqlite-vss` add this capability.

      * **What it's good for:** Storing vector embeddings and performing efficient similarity searches (e.g., cosine similarity) on them.
      * **How it helps you:** This is the backend for a semantic search system. You would still need to generate the embeddings yourself (using a library like `@tensorflow/tfjs`), but you could store and query them directly within your SQLite database, avoiding the need for a separate vector DB like Pinecone or Chroma.

### Comparing the NPM Modules

Here’s a head-to-head comparison of `natural`, `wink-nlp`, and `@tensorflow/tfjs` for your specific cybersecurity use case.

| Feature | `natural` | `wink-nlp` | `@tensorflow/tfjs` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use** | Classic, statistical NLP (TF-IDF, string distance) | Production-grade, fast NLP preprocessing & modeling | Running ML/DL models (e.g., BERT) in JavaScript |
| **Best For** | A lightweight step-up from character trigrams. Good for lexical similarity metrics like **Jaro-Winkler** or **Levenshtein distance**. | **Fast, custom preprocessing.** It excels at tokenization and, crucially, **custom Named Entity Recognition (NER).** | True semantic understanding by running transformer models to generate embeddings. |
| **Cybersecurity Fit** | Poor. It has no concept of "APT28" or "Cobalt Strike." It just sees them as strings of characters or tokens. | **Excellent.** You can train its NER model to recognize your specific entities (threat actors, malware, TTPs). This is its killer feature for you. | Potentially excellent, but with high effort. You could run a model like SecBERT (if converted to a TF.js format) or fine-tune a smaller model on your data. |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal, pure JS. | Minimal, highly optimized for speed and low memory. | Can be heavy. You have to load the library plus the model weights, which can be hundreds of megabytes. |
| **Complexity** | Low. Easy to pick up and use. | Medium. Very well-documented API. The challenge is in preparing the training data for your custom entities. | High. Requires a deep understanding of ML concepts, model formats, and tensor manipulation. |

**Summary:**

  * **`natural`**: A slightly better version of what you're already doing. It will give you more robust lexical comparison algorithms than simple trigrams but won't solve your core semantic problem.
  * **`@tensorflow/tfjs`**: The most powerful but also the most complex. It's the path to using models like SecBERT without Python, but it's a significant engineering effort and may violate your desire for a lightweight solution.
  * **`wink-nlp`**: The sweet spot. It's lightweight and fast, and it directly addresses your main problem: the model's lack of domain knowledge. By teaching it to recognize your cybersecurity entities, you can transform your unstructured text into structured data.

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

I suggest a two-stage approach that combines the strengths of SQLite and a specialized NLP library.

#### Stage 1: Preprocessing and Entity Extraction with `wink-nlp`

This is the most crucial step. Your goal is to convert a sentence like:

> "The threat actor APT28 used the malware Dropper.X to compromise the system."

into a structured format that understands the key entities:

```json
{
  "text": "The threat actor APT28 used the malware Dropper.X to compromise the system.",
  "entities": [
    { "value": "APT28", "type": "THREAT_ACTOR" },
    { "value": "Dropper.X", "type": "MALWARE" }
  ]
}
```

You would do this for all your documents. The `wink-nlp` documentation has excellent guides on training custom NER models.

#### Stage 2: Similarity Calculation

Now that you have structured data, you can calculate similarity in much more meaningful ways:

1.  **Entity-Based Jaccard Similarity:** For any two documents, calculate the Jaccard similarity of their sets of entities. This measures the overlap of recognized threat actors, malware, etc. It's simple, fast, and highly effective for your use case.

      * *Doc A Entities: {APT28, Dropper.X}*
      * *Doc B Entities: {Fancy Bear, Dropper.X, CVE-2023-1234}*
      * *Intersection: {Dropper.X} (size 1)*
      * *Union: {APT28, Dropper.X, Fancy Bear, CVE-2023-1234} (size 4)*
      * *Similarity = 1 / 4 = 0.25*

2.  **Lexical Similarity on Cleaned Text (TF-IDF):** After removing stop words and replacing your custom entities with their type (e.g., replace "APT28" with "THREAT\_ACTOR"), you can use a classic TF-IDF and cosine similarity. This helps capture the overall topical similarity beyond just the named entities.

3.  **Filtered Semantic Search (Advanced):**

      * **Filter with SQLite FTS5:** Use keywords from one document to find the top `N` candidates from the database.
      * **Re-rank with an ML Model:** For only those `N` candidates, generate embeddings using `@tensorflow/tfjs` with a general-purpose model (like Universal Sentence Encoder). While the model won't know "APT28," it will understand the surrounding context (e.g., "malware," "compromise," "exploit"), which can still provide a powerful similarity signal.

This layered approach gives you the best of all worlds: the domain-specific accuracy of custom NER, the speed of lexical search for filtering, and the option for deep semantic analysis where it counts.
