# Fingerprint V2 - Weight Optimization Analysis

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Context**: Cl0p Oracle Zero-Day Case Study (0.691 score)  
**Question**: Should we adjust dimension weights to better detect this legitimate duplicate?

---

## Executive Summary

**Case**: Oct 9 Cl0p article scored **0.691** against Oct 7 version - just below 0.70 threshold  
**Analysis**: This is a **borderline case by design**, not a weight calibration issue  
**Recommendation**: **Keep current weights** (CVE 40%, Text 20%, Entities 40%)  
**Alternative**: Lower threshold to 0.65 for more aggressive duplicate detection

---

## The 0.691 Case Breakdown

### Current Scoring (Total: 0.691)

| Dimension | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted | Contribution |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **CVE** | 1.000 | 40% | 0.400 | **57.9%** |
| **Text** | 0.406 | 20% | 0.081 | 11.7% |
| **Threat Actor** | 0.750 | 12% | 0.090 | 13.0% |
| **Malware** | 0.000 | 12% | 0.000 | 0.0% |
| **Product** | 1.000 | 8% | 0.080 | 11.6% |
| **Company** | 0.500 | 8% | 0.040 | 5.8% |
| **TOTAL** | - | 100% | **0.691** | 100% |

### Key Observations

1. **CVE (1.0 match) dominated**: Same CVE-2025-61882 = 0.400 out of 0.691 (58% of total score)
2. **Text similarity LOW (0.406)**: Only 40.6% trigram overlap despite similar summaries
3. **Threat Actor HIGH (0.750)**: 3 out of 4 threat actors matched (Cl0p, Graceful Spider, Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters)
4. **Product PERFECT (1.0)**: Both articles mention Oracle E-Business Suite
5. **Company PARTIAL (0.500)**: Oct 9 mentions only Oracle; Oct 7 mentions Oracle + Harvard + CISA + NCSC

## Weight Sensitivity Analysis

### What score would different CVE weights produce?

| CVE Weight | Other Weights | Total Score | Classification | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **40%** (current) | Text 20%, TA 12%, Mal 12%, Prod 8%, Co 8% | **0.691** | BORDERLINE | Current design |
| **50%** | Text 15%, TA 12%, Mal 12%, Prod 6%, Co 5% | **0.721** | UPDATE | Passes threshold |
| **60%** | Text 10%, TA 10%, Mal 10%, Prod 5%, Co 5% | **0.751** | UPDATE | High CVE dominance |
| **30%** | Text 25%, TA 15%, Mal 15%, Prod 8%, Co 7% | **0.643** | BORDERLINE | More text focus |

**Calculation Example (50% CVE)**:
```
Score = (1.0 × 0.50) + (0.406 × 0.15) + (0.750 × 0.12) + (0.0 × 0.12) + (1.0 × 0.06) + (0.5 × 0.05)
      = 0.500 + 0.061 + 0.090 + 0.000 + 0.060 + 0.025
      = 0.736 ✅ UPDATE
```

### What if text similarity was higher?

**Hypothesis**: If text similarity was 0.60 instead of 0.406:

| CVE Weight | Text Weight | Score with 0.406 text | Score with 0.60 text | Difference |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------|
| 40% | 20% | 0.691 | **0.730** | +0.039 |
| 50% | 15% | 0.721 | **0.744** | +0.023 |
| 30% | 25% | 0.643 | **0.692** | +0.049 |

**Insight**: Even with perfect text match (1.0), current weights only add +0.119 to score.

## Why Text Similarity is Low (0.406)

### Article Summaries Compared

**Oct 7 Article** (295 words):
> "The Cl0p ransomware gang is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882, in Oracle's E-Business Suite (EBS). This unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) flaw, with a CVSS score of 9.8, enables attackers to gain complete control over the Concurrent Processing component. The campaign has led to widespread data theft from numerous global organizations, including **Harvard University**, followed by a large-scale extortion campaign. **Oracle has released an emergency out-of-band patch**, and **CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog**, mandating federal agencies to patch immediately. The attack highlights Cl0p's continued proficiency in leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities for mass exploitation, similar to their **previous MOVEit campaign**."

**Oct 9 Article** (280 words):
> "The Cl0p ransomware group is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882, in Oracle's E-Business Suite (EBS). The flaw, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows for unauthenticated remote code execution and affects **EBS versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14**. **Active exploitation began around August 9, 2025**, and escalated on **September 29 when Cl0p launched a large-scale email extortion campaign** targeting executives of compromised organizations. The exploit chain is reportedly complex, involving **five separate bugs**. **Oracle released an emergency patch on October 4, 2025**, and organizations are urged to apply it immediately to prevent data exfiltration and extortion."

### Differences Explaining Low Text Score

| Aspect | Oct 7 | Oct 9 | Impact on Trigrams |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Victim mentioned | Harvard University | None | Different entities |
| Timeline specifics | General | August 9, September 29, October 4 | Different dates |
| Technical details | Concurrent Processing component | 5 bugs, versions 12.2.3-12.2.14 | Different tech terms |
| Context | MOVEit campaign reference | Email extortion campaign details | Different narrative |
| Organizations | CISA, KEV catalog, NCSC | None | Different entities |

**Character Trigram Analysis**:
- Shared core: "cl0p", "ransomware", "cve-2025-61882", "oracle", "e-business suite", "zero-day"
- Oct 7 unique: "harvard", "cisa", "moveit", "kev", "ncsc"
- Oct 9 unique: "august", "september", "october", "12.2.3", "12.2.14", "five bugs"
- Result: ~40% overlap makes sense for continuing story with new details

## Entity Analysis: Why Matches Aren't Perfect

### Threat Actor Match: 0.750 (3 out of 4)

**Oct 7 has 4 threat actors**:
- ✅ Cl0p (matched)
- ✅ Graceful Spider (matched)
- ✅ Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (matched)
- ❌ FIN11 (Oct 7 only)

**Oct 9 has 3 threat actors**:
- ✅ Cl0p (matched)
- ✅ Graceful Spider (matched)
- ✅ Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (matched)

**Jaccard**: intersection = 3, union = 4 → 3/4 = 0.75 ✅

### Company Match: 0.500 (1 out of 2)

**Oct 7 has 2 companies**:
- ✅ Oracle (matched)
- ❌ Harvard University (Oct 7 only)

**Oct 9 has 1 company**:
- ✅ Oracle (matched)

**Jaccard**: intersection = 1, union = 2 → 1/2 = 0.50 ✅

### Product Match: 1.000 (Perfect)

**Both articles**:
- ✅ Oracle E-Business Suite

**Jaccard**: intersection = 1, union = 1 → 1/1 = 1.00 ✅

### Malware Match: 0.000 (None)

**Neither article extracted malware entities**  
**Reason**: LLM didn't extract "Cl0p" as malware type (it was extracted as threat_actor instead)

---

## Weight Adjustment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Increase CVE to 50% (Aggressive CVE Focus)

**New Weights**:
- CVE: 50% (was 40%)
- Text: 15% (was 20%)
- Threat Actor: 12% (same)
- Malware: 12% (same)
- Product: 6% (was 8%)
- Company: 5% (was 8%)

**Cl0p Case Result**: 0.736 (UPDATE ✅)

**Pros**:
- Catches this legitimate duplicate
- Emphasizes CVE as primary signal even more
- Within 30-day window, CVE match is highly indicative

**Cons**:
- Less weight on text narrative (may miss borderline cases without CVEs)
- Product/Company signals diminished
- May create false positives when same CVE used in different contexts

### Scenario 2: Increase Text to 25% (Balanced Approach)

**New Weights**:
- CVE: 35% (was 40%)
- Text: 25% (was 20%)
- Threat Actor: 12% (same)
- Malware: 12% (same)
- Product: 8% (same)
- Company: 8% (same)

**Cl0p Case Result**: 0.671 (still BORDERLINE ❌)

**Pros**:
- Better captures narrative evolution
- Helps articles without CVEs

**Cons**:
- Doesn't solve this case
- Reduces CVE signal strength

### Scenario 3: Redistribute Entity Weights

**New Weights**:
- CVE: 40% (same)
- Text: 20% (same)
- Threat Actor: 15% (was 12%)
- Malware: 10% (was 12%)
- Product: 10% (was 8%)
- Company: 5% (was 8%)

**Cl0p Case Result**: 0.703 (UPDATE ✅)

**Pros**:
- Catches this case
- Emphasizes threat actor (more stable than company)
- Reduces company weight (often changes with new victims)

**Cons**:
- Only marginal improvement (+0.012)
- May not help other borderline cases

---

## Recommendation: Keep Current Weights

### Why the 0.691 Score is CORRECT

This case is **intentionally borderline** because:

1. **Different narrative angles**: Oct 7 focused on Harvard victim + CISA response; Oct 9 focused on timeline + technical details
2. **Low text similarity (40.6%)** reflects genuine content differences
3. **Missing entities**: Oct 9 dropped Harvard, CISA, NCSC context
4. **Continuing story, not duplicate**: These are legitimate updates with new information

### Design Philosophy

The Fingerprint V2 system is designed to answer:
> "Is this article **substantially the same** as an existing one?"

**0.691 means**: 
- ✅ Same CVE (100% match)
- ✅ Same threat actors (75% match)
- ❌ Different narrative focus (40% text match)
- ✅ Same product (100% match)
- ⚠️ Different victim/org mentions (50% match)

**Verdict**: These are **related but distinct** articles covering the same campaign from different angles.

---

## Alternative: Adjust Threshold Instead of Weights

### Option A: Lower Threshold to 0.65

**Impact**:
- 0.691 Cl0p case → UPDATE ✅
- More aggressive duplicate detection
- May catch more borderline cases

**Risk**:
- False positives: Different angles of same story marked as duplicates
- Less conservative classification

### Option B: Use Confidence Bands

| Score Range | Classification | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 0.00-0.35 | NEW | Publish as new article |
| 0.35-0.60 | BORDERLINE-LOW | Likely new, quick manual review |
| 0.60-0.75 | **BORDERLINE-HIGH** | **Likely duplicate, detailed review** |
| 0.75-1.00 | UPDATE | Clear duplicate, mark accordingly |

**0.691 falls in BORDERLINE-HIGH**: Flag for manual review, lean toward duplicate.

### Option C: Dynamic Threshold Based on CVE Match

```
if CVE_score == 1.0:
    threshold = 0.60  # Lower bar when CVE matches perfectly
else:
    threshold = 0.70  # Higher bar when no CVE or partial match
```

**Rationale**: Same CVE within 30-day window is strong signal; allow text/entity variations.

---

## Validation: Other Cases

### Storm-1175 GoAnywhere Case: 0.764 (UPDATE ✅)

```
CVE:          1.000 × 0.4 = 0.400 (58.8% of total)
Text:         0.420 × 0.2 = 0.084
Threat Actor: 1.000 × 0.12 = 0.120 (perfect match)
Product:      1.000 × 0.08 = 0.080 (perfect match)
Company:      1.000 × 0.08 = 0.080 (perfect match)
TOTAL: 0.764
```

**Why higher than Cl0p case?**
- Perfect threat actor match (1.0 vs 0.75)
- Perfect company match (1.0 vs 0.5)
- Slightly higher text similarity (0.42 vs 0.406)

**Current weights work perfectly here** ✅

### Redis RCE Case: 0.498 (BORDERLINE ⚠️)

```
CVE:          1.000 × 0.4 = 0.400 (80.3% of total)
Text:         0.490 × 0.2 = 0.098
Threat Actor: 0.000 × 0.12 = 0.000 (no threat actors extracted)
Malware:      0.000 × 0.12 = 0.000
Product:      0.000 × 0.08 = 0.000 (product extraction varied)
Company:      0.000 × 0.08 = 0.000
TOTAL: 0.498
```

**Why so low?**
- CVE match alone (40%)
- Higher text match (49%) adds 10%
- Zero entity overlap → entities not consistently extracted

**This is correctly BORDERLINE**: Same CVE but weak supporting signals.

## Conclusion

### Current Weights Are Well-Calibrated ✅

| Case | Score | Classification | Correct? | Reason |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Storm-1175 GoAnywhere | 0.764 | UPDATE | ✅ Yes | Clear duplicate with perfect entity matches |
| Cl0p Oracle | 0.691 | BORDERLINE | ✅ Yes | Related but distinct articles, different focus |
| Redis RCE | 0.498 | BORDERLINE | ✅ Yes | Same CVE but weak narrative/entity connection |

### Recommended Actions

**Option 1: Keep Current Design (Recommended)**
- Threshold: 0.70
- Weights: CVE 40%, Text 20%, TA 12%, Mal 12%, Prod 8%, Co 8%
- Rationale: 0.691 being borderline is **correct by design**

**Option 2: Lower Threshold to 0.65 (More Aggressive)**
- Catches Cl0p case as UPDATE
- Risk: May over-classify related-but-distinct articles as duplicates
- Use case: When minimizing duplicates is more important than capturing narrative variations

**Option 3: Implement Dynamic Threshold**
- Perfect CVE match: threshold = 0.60
- No CVE match: threshold = 0.70
- Rationale: CVE is campaign identifier; allow more text variation when CVE matches

**Option 4: Add Confidence Bands**
- 0.60-0.75: BORDERLINE-HIGH (flag for manual review, lean duplicate)
- Preserves nuance without changing weights

### Weight Changes Not Recommended

**CVE weight increase (40% → 50%)**:
- ❌ Creates CVE over-dependence
- ❌ Reduces text narrative signal too much
- ❌ May miss CVE-less articles

**Entity weight redistribution**:
- ❌ Only marginal gains (+0.012)
- ❌ Doesn't address root cause (low text similarity)
- ❌ May hurt other cases
